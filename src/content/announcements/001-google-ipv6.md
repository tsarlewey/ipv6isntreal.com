THE BEAST SYSTEM AWAKENS. Google - the all-seeing eye of the internet - has activated IPv6 across ALL services. This isn't about "address space." This is about TOTAL INFORMATION AWARENESS. 128 bits = 128 chains. Every search, every email, every thought you type - now tagged with YOUR permanent digital fingerprint. The New World Order's surveillance grid is ONLINE. They told you it was about "running out of addresses." THEY LIED.
