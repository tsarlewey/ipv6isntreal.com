THEY'RE ADDING MORE TENTACLES. The IETF - an unelected body of "engineers" - just published ANOTHER RFC expanding IPv6's capabilities. "Extension headers" they call them. BACKDOORS is what they are. Hop-by-hop options? That's code for "we can inspect your packets at every router." Destination options? "We know exactly where you're going." The protocol was DESIGNED for surveillance. Every RFC just adds more hooks for the puppet masters.
