MANUFACTURED SCARCITY - THE OLDEST TRICK. RIPE declares IPv4 "exhausted" while corporations HOARD millions of unused addresses. Apple has 17 MILLION. Ford has 16 MILLION. MIT has 16 MILLION. The "exhaustion" is a LIE to force migration. Create the crisis. Provide the solution. Problem-reaction-solution. Hegelian dialectic in network form. They could redistribute. They could reclaim. They CHOOSE not to. Because the goal was never addresses. The goal was CONTROL.
