OPT-OUT IS THE NEW OPT-IN. Verizon's latest routers ship with IPv6 ENABLED. Not optional. Not asked. ENABLED. Your grandmother's router. Your neighbor's router. Every new customer - IPv6'd without consent. The setting is buried twelve menus deep. THEY KNOW you won't find it. "Fiber to the home" was always about SURVEILLANCE to the home. Light travels both ways in fiber. They send you Netflix. You send them EVERYTHING.
