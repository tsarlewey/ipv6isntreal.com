GERMANY LEADS AGAIN - IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. The country with the STRICTEST privacy laws in Europe now leads in adopting the LEAST private protocol. GDPR was theater. The real data flows through IPv6. German efficiency applied to surveillance. Every Deutsche Telekom customer, tagged and tracked with Teutonic precision. They learned from their history, they said. They would never track citizens again, they said. They just outsourced it to the protocol layer.
