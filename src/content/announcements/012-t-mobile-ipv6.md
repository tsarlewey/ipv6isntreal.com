THE UN-CARRIER CARRIES YOUR DATA TO THEM. T-Mobile celebrates 90% IPv6 adoption like it's an ACHIEVEMENT. Your phone - your most personal device, the one that knows your location 24/7 - now broadcasts a unique 128-bit identifier with every packet. "Un-carrier" is NEWSPEAK. They carry more data about you than ever before. Every text. Every call. Every cell tower ping. All correlated to YOUR address. Magenta is the color of the prison uniform.
