THE CULT OF CUPERTINO DEMANDS COMPLIANCE. Apple - keeper of the walled garden - now REQUIRES IPv6 for App Store approval. Not "recommends." REQUIRES. Two million apps. Billions of users. All FORCED into the IPv6 panopticon. First they took the headphone jack. Then they took the home button. Now they take your ANONYMITY. "Think Different" they said. Now you'll think TRACKED. Every app you use, reporting to the mothership via a 128-bit leash.
