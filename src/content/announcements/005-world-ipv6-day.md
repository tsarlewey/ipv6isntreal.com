ANNUAL PROPAGANDA RITUAL OBSERVED. The "Internet Society" - a front organization if there ever was one - celebrated another "World IPv6 Launch Day." A HOLIDAY for a PROTOCOL. When was the last time you celebrated TCP day? HTTP day? They've been "launching" since 2012. Fourteen years of "launching." It's not a launch, it's a SLOW BOIL. The frog doesn't jump if the water heats gradually. Ribbits of celebration while the pot reaches boiling point.
