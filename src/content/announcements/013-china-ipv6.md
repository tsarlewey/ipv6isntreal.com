THE DRAGON'S DIGITAL SCALES COVER ALL. 700 MILLION. China - architect of the Great Firewall, pioneer of social credit - now has more IPv6 users than most countries have PEOPLE. This is the blueprint. This is the PROOF OF CONCEPT. Every citizen tracked, scored, and controlled. And the West watches and takes NOTES. When they tell you "China is authoritarian, we're different" - ask why we're adopting the SAME PROTOCOLS. The Great Firewall doesn't keep the world out. It keeps the citizens IN.
