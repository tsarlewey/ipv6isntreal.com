BEZOS CUTS THE CORD. Amazon Web Services now offers IPv6-ONLY subnets. Read that again. NO IPv4. NO ESCAPE. The cloud isn't floating above us - it's a NET closing around us. Every startup, every enterprise, every government agency running on AWS is now FULLY MAPPED in the IPv6 grid. Phase 2 isn't "complete" - it was complete years ago. We're in Phase 5 and they're just NOW telling you about Phase 2. WAKE UP.
