GATES' GRID GOES GLOBAL. Microsoft Azure - the "cloud" that runs governments, banks, and hospitals - has activated IPv6 in EVERY REGION on Earth. No continent left behind. No server untagged. Every VM, every container, every serverless function - NUMBERED and CATALOGUED. The same company that put a computer in every home now puts an address on every process. From MS-DOS to MS-DOSSIER. They're not building the future. They're building the PRISON.
