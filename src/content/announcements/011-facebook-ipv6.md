ZUCKERBERG'S WEB IS COMPLETE. Meta - the company that literally RENAMED ITSELF after the digital prison it's building - reports 99% IPv6 capability. ONE PERCENT from total coverage. They know your friends. They know your face. They know your messages. Now they know your DEVICE FINGERPRINT with 128 bits of precision. The Metaverse isn't virtual reality. It's TOTAL REALITY CAPTURE. Put on the headset. Join the simulation. Your IPv6 address is your inmate number.
