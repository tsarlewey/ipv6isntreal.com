THEY'RE TAGGING YOUR TOASTER. The IoT consortium - an unaccountable cabal of manufacturers - now MANDATES IPv6 for all "smart" devices. Your lightbulb gets an address. Your doorbell gets an address. Your TOOTHBRUSH gets an address. 50 billion devices by 2030, each one a SENSOR in your home. "Smart" is marketing speak for SNITCH. Every device reports home. Every device has YOUR address. Your home isn't smart. It's WIRED for surveillance.
