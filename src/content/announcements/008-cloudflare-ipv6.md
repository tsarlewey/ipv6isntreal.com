THE HALFWAY POINT OF NO RETURN. Cloudflare - the company that sits between YOU and EVERY WEBSITE - reports 50% IPv6 adoption. Half the internet is now in their grid. But here's what they WON'T tell you: Cloudflare sees ALL traffic. They ARE the man-in-the-middle. And now half of that traffic carries permanent identifiers. The "Project Galileo" wasn't about protecting websites. It was about MAPPING them. The radar isn't watching threats. The radar is watching YOU.
