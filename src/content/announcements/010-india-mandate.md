1.4 BILLION SOULS TAGGED. India's government has MANDATED IPv6 across all government networks. When the world's largest democracy makes surveillance MANDATORY, it's not democracy anymore. Aadhaar was just the beginning - a billion biometric IDs. Now every government computer, every state database, every digital service - all on the IPv6 grid. The largest population on Earth, fully enumerated. This isn't governance. This is INVENTORY MANAGEMENT.
