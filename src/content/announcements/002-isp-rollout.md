THE TRAP IS SET. Comcast. Verizon. AT&T. The unholy trinity of telecom is flipping the switch on IPv6 - and YOU didn't consent. NAT was our SHIELD. Our last line of defense. Now? Every smart speaker, every baby monitor, every device in your home gets a GLOBALLY UNIQUE ADDRESS. They can see your refrigerator. They can COUNT your light bulbs. This isn't networking - it's a CENSUS OF YOUR LIFE. The watchers no longer need warrants. They just need your prefix.
